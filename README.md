# Pyromania - Time to burn

## Our contracts at MainNet
https://etherscan.io/address/0x22f298b0c4d7bd8b939bc703a365b704df45e3a1 - Furance contract, burning tokens
https://etherscan.io/token/0x5e4dd41c7b32d6cf86fa6b511187fe97ed7b6acc - PYRO token, new proof of burn cryptocurrency


## Inspiration

What is dead may never DAI.
There is a huge amount of tokens in ETH workspace. Some of them become almost useless.

## What it does

We made 100% recyclable token: By deep-math crypto-economics under the hood - we buidl token, that cleanup whole blockchain ecosystem.

- Clean ethereum with burning tokens, shows how much storage saved
- Get's back pyro tokens, that worth money. And it even stable because of moon math under the hood!
- Easily buy required tokens to burn from our UI (by Bankor or 0x)

We did token analytics and pick some low trading tokens. (+ some token from 0x, with notable history)

> Aeternity
> Early contributors to ethereum branched out and chose to launch a separate blockchain. The project raised funds during an ICO in the midst of ERC-20 ICO-craze. However, ultimately, existing on a separate chain meant not being part of the ecosystem and the project remains obscure. The price of a token went up and down with the mania and wobbles around the ICO-levels. However, hardly there are any Dapps written in Sophia smart contract programming language that are known to community.

## How we built it

Gang of four with super skills in: solidity, node.js, ens, kubernetes, redis, 0x, skale and so on.

## Challenges we ran into

Cryptoeconimic math way differs from classic economic. please look into the description for formula.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Pure math under the hood
- Ability to clean up blockchain and free-up space

## Pyromania math model

We determine burnrate of the token as following recurrent formula:

$$ r_i = r_{i-1} \alpha^{\Delta t_i} + b_i$$

where $\Delta t_i$ is a number of blocks between burn events and $b_i$ is the amount of burned tokens at the current event, $\alpha$ is decay parameter, we set the decay as $0.5$ multiplier per day.

We estimate mint amount as

$$ c_i = a(\sqrt{r_i} - \sqrt{r_i - b_i}) $$.

$a$ is scaling parameter, we set it such, that estimated time to burn all token grows as square root of token market cap.

If we get a situation when there is only one token-holder, he can emulate mint procedure by spending a little amount of token. To protect from this we add a new variable $\kappa$ - this is the global price cap, so $c_i/b_i$ cannot be more than $\kappa$.

If $c_i/b_i > \kappa$, we redefine $c_i$ as $c_i = b_i\kappa$.

At each step we determine $\kappa = (\kappa_0 w + \sum_{i-1} c_i)/(w + \sum_{i-1} b_i)$, where

$\kappa_0$ and $\omega$ are initial parameters. 


## What's next for Pyromania - Time to burn!

- Add voting system, to add new tokens
